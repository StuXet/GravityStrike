#Gravity Strike
is a funny action shooter PC game with a gravity gun instead of weapons.

Players will have to search for red boxes and shoot them at other players

In a free for all mod.

This DEMO was submitted as a Unity Multiplayer final project in our Unity Multiplayer course

and was passionately developed by Me

*** Important Note ***

There are red boxes and 1 blue box that you can pick on the map

Red boxes give damage and the blue box give health

"E" key is for picking the boxes

"LMC" for shooting the box

Before picking the box, use "LMC" on the box and then the "E" key
